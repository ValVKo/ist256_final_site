# Feedback

## Usability Session 1

**Passenger Notes:** I noticed the login page / checkout on header seemed easy to miss â€“ needs to be made obvious 

**Driver Notes:** User 1 provided the following feedback...
The site looks nice, but the login symbol looks like it means 'logout' instead of 'log into account'

**Takeaways:** I plan to change the navigation bar to make the navigation links easier to notice, and the login symbol

## Usability Session 2

**Passenger Notes:** I noticed that the login was again not noticable

**Driver Notes:** User 2 provided the following feedback...
The front page was thought to be the store page

**Takeaways:** I plan to change the front page by giving it more content and links to the store page
